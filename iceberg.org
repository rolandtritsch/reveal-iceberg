  - Develop and idea how the garden needs to look like ...
  - Put a couple of seeds into the ground (the right kind of seeds in the right place) ...
  - ... and then work very hard to make it grow (lot's of water and fertilizer)!

* The Iceberg

** By getting really good at managing the Iceberg!
   - Developing awareness & Managing expectations
   - PS: That's just one of the things that you need to do to make Software Gardening work

** What's the Iceberg?
   - Initially you have 10 developers and 8 of them work on features!
   - Some time later you have 100 developers and 25 work on features!
   - 10 times more people. 3 times more features. WTF!!!

** What's the Iceberg? 
   #+REVEAL_HTML: <div class="column" style="float:left; width: 80%">
   - 80% of the work is under water!!!
   - Moving from building a solution to **owning** a solution
     - Owning code is expensive!
   - Moving from 10 people to 100 people is expensive!
     - Hiring, on-boarding, churn (100%), ..., communication, ...
   - Moving from 100 customers to 5000 customers is expensive!
     - Higher expectations wrt. uptime, processes, professionalism, ...
